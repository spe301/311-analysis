# 311-analysis

## The Data
We have all of the 311 service requests in 2020, totaling 1.4 million. The goal is to identify patterns in the service requests whether it be location, proximity to certain landmarks, time of day, or means of communication (ie. phone vs. email). For context 311, better known as MyLA311, works to connect local Los Angeles residents to City Services quickly and efficiently as well as perform Service Requests intake on behalf of City Departments like taking down grafitti or clean up illegal dumpings. 

I recently startedworking a Tableau Report for this dataset.
